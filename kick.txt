"Time for you to leave. I did, now I'm happy."
"Use, but never overuse IRC, then you will also be happy within IRC"
"Without the Tao of Internet Relay Chat, life becomes meaningless."
"Any automata should not speak unless spoken to."
"Any automata shall only whisper when spoken to."
"You must must BE the IRC before automating."
Many lusers have fallen into the clutches of ethernal damnation. 
They were not following the Tao.
The luser was not within the Tao
There should always be an ignore.
Without ignore the client is not within the Tao of IRC.
"To be Tao is to be ones true self."
"To hide ones self is not Tao, and is not IRC"
The flock are told about the Tao and make a fool of the IRC.
If there was no laughter, there would be no Tao. 
This is the very nature of the IRC.
Only channel 0 is the right path to Tao, but avoid speaking on channel 0.
In the beginning there was only channel 0, thus channel 0 is the soil of IRC.
The sage luser must be aware like a frog crossing the highway.
If the Tao is great, then the IRC is running ceaselessly.
If the IRC is great, then the server is running without ever stopping.
Something is formed by the electrons, born in the silent cable.
Shaping and growing and ungrowing. It is there yet not there.
The Tao of IRC squits far away and connects on returning.
The genetic potential of birth, a lot to know, yet unknown.
This was the right Tao.
