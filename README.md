mIRCScripts
===========

A small repository of mIRC scripts that are mine

They are not really anything special or useful; but I thought it might be useful to share the code out in a usable manner so that
my scripts can be seen. 

These are written in mSL, the mIRC scripting language. If you don't know or understand that then please don't worry. 

You may submit issues for my personal branch for support. (If for example my script in your channel is doing something funky)

Most of the time issues will be patched immediately by disabling the script...but later commits might actually include fixes.

You may notice there are often some disabled scripts. They are useful but may be disarmed for various reasons, for example scripts designed to keep me present in channels...which only get run if I'm actually THERE to participate anyways. TL;DR if it's not usually necessary, it may be disabled. I may even write scripts to solve problems that I may be asked not to run, or should not run. Rest assured that I do check for these things and don't often run such things if I am asked/warned not to. If you're concerned...submit an issue or just ping me on IRC and talk!
